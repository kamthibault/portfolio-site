    Career Goals</h1>

<body>
<p>My career goal is to obtain my degree in business analytics and information systems then use that knowledge 
    to get a career in sports analytics to pursue a my passion of sports. I am intrigued in pursuing a sports gambling career at a company like draft kings
    but I mainly am looking To get a career that revolves around sports data in some way. With my primary goal being a career in sports analytics
    I also have a goal of finding a career that I enjoy. With my degree in BAIS I am confident I will find a career that i will enjoy due to the wide range of opportunities.
    Ultimately my career goals are to stay true to who I am by pursuing sports analytics rather than going into a career that I can't picture myself long term.</p>
